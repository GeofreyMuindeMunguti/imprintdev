          <h1 class="brief-title">The brief</h1>
          <p class="brief-content">Tactive consulting is a consulting firm that focuses on designing scalable 
              solutions towards unlocking growth for SMEs. Founder and Entrepreneur Kaye Matereke, recognized that 
              many small businesses were unaware of their risk exposure and hence unable to plan effectively when 
              faced with unpredictable disruptions to their business environment.
              <br>
              <br>
              Tactive’s response to the Covid 19 
              pandemic, was to design an automated platform that uses artificial intelligence in supporting small 
              businesses in assessing their risks, and providing these businesses with recommendations to support them 
              develop Business Continuity Strategies. 

              <br>
              <br>

            Access to finance or working credit also continues to be a lifeline for many small businesses. 
            Digitization is becoming critical in order to demonstrate traction and increase 
            chances of access to finance by lenders.
            
        </p>

        <h1 class="brief-title">Our approach</h1>
        <p class="brief-content">We developed an automated BCP platform that uses survey data to collect information 
            from small businesses. It then uses machine learning (statistical techniques) to mine insights from these 
            businesses to provide the businesses in question, their investors and their lenders with real time data 
            around their risks.
 
        </p>

        <h1 class="brief-title">The result</h1>

        <p class="brief-content">Tactive Consulting is using the platform in collaboration with Development Finance Institutions, 
            Investors and Lenders to design interventions that support continuity and growth for SMEs
            in the post-covid world.SMEs & Business Development Services institutions in Kenya and Uganda are utilizing the BCP platform
            towards preserving the value they continue to create in their ecosystems.
